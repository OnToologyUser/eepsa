<p>The EEPSA (Energy Efficiency Prediction Semantic Assistant) ontology is a core ontology focused on energy efficiency and thermal comfort in tertiary buildings but it is aimed at being reusable and easily customizable for other use cases in similar domains.</p>

<p>Following a well-known ontology development methodology, the requirements of the ontology were collected first. Then, the backbone of the EEPSA ontology was discussed and defined as a combination of three ODPs which try to be minimal in the number of classes and properties offered but complete with respect to the considered CQs and including appropriate ontology axioms that allow proper inferences. Moreover, the careful design of property axioms overcome some weaknesses discovered in existing ontologies. On top of these ODPs, a set of ontology modules were developed, each of them specializing knowledge in the scope of the stub classes defined in the ODPs and reusing existing resources to the extent possible. Furthermore, in order to contribute to the interoperability of the solution, EEPSA ODPs and ontology modules are aligned with other related ontologies as well as upper-level ontologies. All these developments are properly documented and made available online.</p>

<p>Thanks to the design of the EEPSA ontology and the high encapsulation of its modules, the customization of the ontology to address similar problems in different use cases is feasible. Such a customization is based on ontology module replacement.</p>
